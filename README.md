# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project explores customer segmentation using K-means clustering. Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so that companies can better understand and serve their customers. K-means clustering is a commonly used unsupervised learning technique that groups data points together based on their similarity.

We will be working with a Mall_Customer dataset and will be clustering customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score. The goal is to identify different customer segments and understand their unique characteristics, so that marketing and sales strategies can be tailored to each segment.

Libraries Used:- pandas,scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

Elbow method is used to find optimal number of clusters.

The project will involve the following steps:

Data preprocessing: cleaning and preparing the dataset for clustering

Exploratory data analysis: visualizing and understanding the data

Feature selection: selecting relevant features for clustering

Model training: applying the K-means algorithm to the dataset

Model evaluation: evaluating the quality of the clusters and selecting the optimal number of clusters

Interpretation and visualization: interpreting the results and visualizing the customer segments
